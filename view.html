					<h5><strong>Unit 1</strong> · Things we like doing</h5>
					<h1>An unusual hobby</h1>
					<p>Julie Baker is 16 and Australian. She likes music, swimming, going to the cinema and <span class="reveal">hanging out</span><small>（闲逛）</small> with friends. She's a very normal 16-year-old. But she has an <span class="reveal">unusual</span><small>（不同寻常的）</small> hobby: flying <span class="reveal">helicopters</span><small>（直升机）</small> .</p><p>
					Julie is a student at the Helicopter Flying School near Brisbane. Here is her typical Sunday:<br/>
					7:00    Julie <span class="reveal">gets up</span><small>（起床）</small>. <br/>
					7:45-8:00    Julie's parents drive her to the helicopter school. (Julie hasn't got a driving license.) <br/>8:00-10:45    Her lesssons start. Julie is in a group with five other students. The teacher tells them how to fly a helicopter, for example, how to take off and how to land. Julie doesn't like classroom work very much, but she knows it's important. <br/>
					11:00-12:00     Julie and her friends learn how to use the radio and how to read maps. <br/>
					12:00-1:00     Julie is in the pilot's seat and her teacher is next to her. She flies for one hour. She loves it. She enjoys looking down at the Sunshine Coast. <br/>
					1:15     Julie's dad drives her home. He's very happy that she's back and that she's OK. “I hate watching Julie up in the helicopter,” he says. “Her mother and I get nervous. But we know she loves flying. She wants to be a pilot and we don't want to stop her.” </p>
